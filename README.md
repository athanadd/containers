# containers

Docker containers are an excelent way to isolate running applications and make your research or work more reproducible.
I usually try to use containers in my in silico biological research and bioinformatics analysis. One excelent repository, namely biocontainers, maintains a great collection of tools applicable to biological analyses. In this repo I store containers of applications usually relevant to biology, that I could not find anywhere else.
Feel free to use and modify the provided Dockerfiles to build your own containers.
Pre-built containers can be downloaded from my DockerHub. Links are available in each container seperately.

Let me know if you need a relevant container that is not listed here and I will look into that.
